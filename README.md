# Workshop: Creating Kubernetes Apps with Backstage

This hands-on workshop will guide you through creating Kubernetes application manifests using Backstage Software Templates. You'll create a complete set of Kubernetes manifests that can be deployed through ArgoCD.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the Backstage portal
- GitHub account
- Access to ArgoCD dashboard 

## Workshop Steps

### 1. Access the Backstage Portal

Navigate to the Backstage portal in your browser.

#### Access localhost:7007

### 2. Create a New Component

1. Click on the **Create** button in the left navigation panel
2. Find and select the **Kubernetes Application Template**
   - Template URL: `https://github.com/PawelWaj/workshop/blob/main/templates/kubernetes-app-template.yaml`

### 3. Fill in Template Details

Complete the form with the following details:

**Application Information:**
- **Application Name**: Enter a name for your application (use lowercase letters only)
- **Team Name**: Enter your team name (this will also be used as the namespace)
- **Application Description**: Enter a brief description of your application

**Configuration Details:**
- **Container Image**: Use the default (`nginx:latest`) or specify another image
- **Replicas**: Set the number of replicas (default is 1)
- **Custom Label**: Add any random text as a custom label

**Repository Information:**
- **Repository Location**: Select the repository where you want to create the Kubernetes manifests

### 4. Generate the Template

Click the **Create** button at the bottom of the form to generate your Kubernetes manifests.


### 5. Create an ArgoCD Application

Now that your manifests are in a public repository, create an ArgoCD application to deploy them:

1. Log in to the ArgoCD dashboard
2. kubectl -n argocd port-forward svc/argocd-server 8080:80
3. access localhost:8080
4. Click the **+ New App** button
5. Fill in the application details:
   - **Application Name**: Use the same name as in Backstage
   - **Project**: Select `default` or the appropriate project
   - **Repository URL**: Enter your GitHub repository URL
   - **Path**: Enter `k8s` (this is where your manifests are located)
   - **Cluster**: Select your target Kubernetes cluster
   - **Namespace**: Enter the team name you used in Backstage

6. Click **Create** to deploy your application

### 6. Verify Deployment

1. In the ArgoCD dashboard, click on your newly created application
2. Check that all resources are synced and healthy
3. Verify the deployment in Kubernetes:
   ```bash
   kubectl get all -n <your-team-name>
   ```

## Success Criteria

âœ… You have successfully:
- Created Kubernetes manifests using Backstage templates
- Made your repository public for ArgoCD access
- Created an ArgoCD application that refers to your manifests
- Deployed your application to Kubernetes

## Troubleshooting

- **Registration Error**: If you encounter registration errors in Backstage, make sure all form fields are filled out correctly
- **ArgoCD Sync Error**: If ArgoCD can't sync, verify that your repository is public
- **Deployment Issues**: Check ArgoCD logs and event messages for any deployment errors
